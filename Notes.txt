for 1.0.1:

Fixed settings points while in freecamera.
Fixed text alignment issues in the Flow Menu
Disabled mouse and keyboard inputs while the camera is moving.
Fixed an issue with the cam bugging out when the camera is started while sitting on a bench or chair.

1.0.3:
Rewrote path calculation to equally space all the points, the speed of the movement should now be a lot smoother no matter the distance of the points.
Note: If you have used the mod before you will have to adjust your settings as the Resolution value was changed in how it works. I recommend setting it to the displayed default value.
Reduced the size of the point to point renderer, fixed issues with displaying it.
Reduced unnecessary calculations.
Improved the CameraFlow Menu.
Added a button to delete saved paths.

1.0.4:
Changed path preview to no longer be culled at longer distances.
The mod no longer uses debug commands, so your console history should now no longer be disturbed.
While the camera is moving it will now activate god mode to prevent possible camera desyncs.
Added an option to the Config to keep GodMode enabled when the path is finished. If disabled godmode will be turned off.
Fixed camera movement loop not stopping when exiting to the main menu while the camera is moving.
Fixed issues with ui not enabling again if the player exits to the main menu while the camera is moving.

1.0.5:
Reworked rotation completely, it now creates much smoother rotation. This can cause visual issues on points that are very close together, but should lead to highly improved results in most cases.
Loading and saving Paths no longer requires a restart to be shown in the Menu.
Switching points while the preview is disabled will no longer enable it.
When starting the camera the CameraFlow Menu will now close and cannot be opened anymore to prevent changes to the path during travel.
Prevented placement of points while the camera is moving.
